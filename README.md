# -Real-time-Image-Processing

There are only source files in repository due to the large size of the entire project

The project included:
 - MATLAB model that includes a hardware-oriented implementation of the algorithm, used for simulation and validation
 - Capturing real-time video from a camera,
 - Fixed-point RGB to YCbCr color space conversion (custom module),
 - Binary image generation,
 - Switch-controlled selection of which image (RGB, YCbCr, or binary) is displayed
